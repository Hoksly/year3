The provided automaton is non-deterministic due to the presence of epsilon (ε) transitions. 
These transitions enable the automaton to potentially follow different state sequences for the same input string. 
To convert this automaton to a deterministic one, we need to eliminate the ε-transitions while preserving the accepted language. 
This language can be represented by the regular expression (xz)*(x|y).
